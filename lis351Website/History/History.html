			<dt><h3>NFL Career:</h3></dt>
				<dd style="font-family:courier;">With the impressive numbers Aaron put up at Berkeley, he was expected to be the number 1 draft pick. 
				Of course the team that had the number 1 draft pick was the team Aaron grew up supporting and wanted to play for, the San Francisco 49ers. 
				The 49ers however went on to draft a different quarterback, Alex Smith, and Aaron went on to be drafted by the Green Bay Packers with the 24th draft pick. 
				From. 2005 to 2007, Aaron would be the backup quarterback to one of the greats, Brett Favre, where he would learn and develop. 
				In the 2008 season, Aaron would replace Brett Favre as the starting quarterback for the Green Bay Packers and the rest of the story is history. 
				Going on to many successful seasons with the Packers and hopefully many more to come.</dd>
